                <h2>5 Years From Now</h2>
                <p>As an average student in class 2025, how do I see myself 
                    five years from now?
                </p>
                <p>Since I was a kid, I have always wanted to be one of the 
                    most successful chefs. Wait? How is being a chef connected
                     to the IT industry?
                    Of course, nothing! From a family that is financially 
                    struggling, getting accepted at a university that has no
                     fees was a big thing. I was lucky, indeed!
                </p>
                <p>But the dream of being one of the most successful chefs 
                    didn't work out. I got accepted at PUP Taguig, but the 
                    course that I was bumped into was a diploma.
                    in information technology. I was stuck in a decision about
                     whether I would pursue my dream or accept the opportunity
                      I was facing. That 18-year-old back then
                    doesn't know anything about computers. How can she 
                    survive?
                </p>
                <p>In the first year of my college life, I enjoy how we 
                    assemble and disassemble parts of system units. My first 
                    impression was that IT was not that difficult, but then I 
                    was wrong.
                    That was when I encountered programming. I'll be honest,
                     programming has always been my enemy. I'm always having 
                     a hard time debugging and understanding how some programs
                      work.
                    but I didn't stop. They say IT is a big industry; maybe I
                     am not good at programming; maybe I am just a late 
                     bloomer; who knows?
                </p>
                <p>Five years from now, I am praying and manifesting that I'll
                     be sitting in those offices where I can call myself part
                      of this industry.
                    I know that the journey won't be easy, and I aspire to
                     learn more and accept all the challenges I will be 
                     facing. Maybe this was never my first choice or my dream.
                    But to be in this situation of life where I can clearly 
                    see how we are struggling so much in terms of financial 
                    problems, who am I to quit?
